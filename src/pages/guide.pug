            | THIS GUIDE IS NOT BEING MAINTAINED AT THE MOMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF
            | INSTRUCTIONS BEING OUT OF DATE AND THE GAME NOT WORKING. TO BE USED AS A REFERENCE FOR MODS ONLY UNTIL 
            | I HAVE TIME TO UPDATE THE GUIDE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

            | This guide is in transition to TTW version 3.2. It is in a state of heavy
            | development. Please report any problems on the
            | #[a(href='https://forum.step-project.com/topic/8447-tale-of-two-wastelands-over-encumbered-edition') TTWOEE forum post],
            | on the #[+link('TTWOEE subreddit', 'https://reddit.com/r/ttwoee')], or on the #[+link('TTWOEE GitHub', 'https://github.com/themagicteeth/ttwoee')]
            | Many mods have not yet been converted for the new version of TTW, therfore they are not
            | included in this guide. It should be playable in it's current state, but no gaurantees are
            | provided.
