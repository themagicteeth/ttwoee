        | Once you have the guide installed, if you would like to add
        | more mods on top of it there are a few things to keep in mind.
    pre.mt0
        | 1. Always refer to the #[+link('Incompatible mods list', 'https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=6878')]
        | 2. If a Fallout 3 mod has a plugin that has not been converted, you MUST DISABLE THE PLUGIN
        | 3. If any plugins are added, the #[+link('merge patch', 'https://ttwoee.com#merge-patch')] must be remade
        | 4. If new locations and/or LOD is added #[+link('LOD', 'https://ttwoee.com#lod')] must be regenerated
        | 5. Keep in mind the plugin limit, and merge plugins together as necessary. Try not to exceed 125 plugins.
        | 6. If new plugins are added, be sure to run LOOT to sort your load order
