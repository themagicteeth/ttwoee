## About

TTWOEE is a modding guide for Tale of Two Wastelands.

## TTW 2.9.4b

Originally the guide was written for TTW version 2.9.4b.
Many of the mods used are no longer compatible. The guide
is now being rewritten for the new version (3+).

## TTW 3+

The new version has been rewritten using the JavaScript library
Pug. This is so it can be built into pure HTML and CSS without
a large amount of JavaScript dependencies for the client.

## Work on TTWOEE

You will need `Git` and `yarn` Node package manager installed.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/themagicteeth/ttwoee.git`

Install the dependencies: `yarn install`

To see any changes made, run `yarn build`. This will compile the Pug templates
and minify the CSS, and is viewable in any browser.


## Notes

The version 3 of the guide is still under heavy development, and is not finished.

The layout of the project structure will change as the project gets more mature.
