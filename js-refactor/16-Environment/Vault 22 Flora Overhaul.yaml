  name: Vault 22 Flora Overhaul
  version: 1.1

  author: Macintroll
  notes:
    This mod trys to add realistic flora overgrown in the vault 22. All levels have
    been modified and cluttered with more flora, ivy, bushes, grasses and some creepy things.
    Game play should be a little more difficult but main quest is almost untouched.
