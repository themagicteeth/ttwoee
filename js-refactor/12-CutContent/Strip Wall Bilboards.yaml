    - Strip Wall Billboards
  notes: Adds previously unused billboards which were only seen during
    the intro to The Strip's perimeter wall making it slightly less
    dull. There are only three images on the billboards used in different
    orientations, but it's still an improvement over the boring vanilla walls.
