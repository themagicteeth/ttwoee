            | It is important that the games installation files are as close to vanilla as possible.
            | Follow the steps below to ensure that your game is free from previous modding files and
            | that the ini files are reset to their default state.

            +important If this is not a clean installation of Fallout New Vegas and you have modded prior perform the following:
            pre.mt0
                | Delete everything in the New Vegas folder except the Data folder.
                | Open the Data folder and delete everything that is not a vanilla ESM or BSA from New Vegas or the DLCs.
                | If you have previously "cleaned" the base game ESMs, delete those as well, as TTW requires them uncleaned.
                |
                | Go to New Vegas in Steam, right click, and select [Properties].
                | Navigate to [Verify Game Cache] option and Steam will download all the necessary files.
                |
                | Optional Tip: Making a archive of the clean game installation with 7Zip is handy for reinstalling Fallout.

            h4.section-header Reset Inis
            +important To ensure the INI files are the vanilla INI files perform the following:
            pre.mt0
                | Navigate to My Games/Documents and delete the following files:
                |
                | Fallout.ini
                | FalloutPrefs.ini
                |
                | This will allow the INIs to revert back to vanilla when the game is launched.
