                | This is an attempt to make the ultimate #[a(href='https://taleoftwowastelands.com/') Tale of Two Wastelands] experience. Enhancing most parts of 
                | both Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. Including graphics, quests, locations,interface, immersion, and gameplay. This guide was created out of a
                | desire to have a stable and  heavily modded Fallout game, that once it was installed could take two of my favorite games and  make them one story,
                | turning two games into one epic one.

            p 
                | It takes many cues from #[a(href='http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Neovalen/Skyrim_Revisited_-_Legendary_Edition') Skyrim Revisited by Neovalen]. 
                | One of the most thorough modding guides around, and an excellent Skyrim guide. After following #[a(href='http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Adonis_VII/TTW') TTW:Worlds of Tomorrow by Adonis_IV]
                | and some of #[a(href='http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Hushpiper/TTW_Core') TTW Core by Hushpiper] (also #[a(href='http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Hushpiper/TTW%2B') TTW+]), 
                | it inspired me to make my own version. My original guide can be found #[a(href='http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Themagicteeth/TTWOverEncumbered') here]. Any questions 
                | or feedback can be posted on TTW:OEE forum post #[a(href='http://forum.step-project.com/topic/8447-tale-of-two-wastelands-over-encumbered-edition/') here].

            p 
                | This is much the same as the above guides but borrows elements from all of them. If you are uninterested in quests/locations, and UI enhancements you may prefer to
                | try Worlds of Tomorrow as it is a bit more condensed. It features less mods, and is made by a very experienced TTW mod maker.

            p 
                | There are other guides that have also been used in creating this guide. #[a(href='http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3') Clear and Present Danger by Kelmych],
                | and #[a(href='http://wiki.step-project.com/User:EssArrBee/FalloutNewVegas') Fear and Loathing in New Vegas by EssArrBee], are both great modding guides if wanting to mod 
                | either game separately. They are both very well written, and provide a great game. This guide will have many similarities to the above guides, and certain elements have
                | been borrowed from them.

        h3.section-header Is Tale of Two Wastelands the best option for you?
        div.copy-bg
            p
                | Tale of Two Wastelands brings Fallout 3 into the New Vegas engine, bringing all the
                | feature and engine upgrades (reputations, crafting, iron sights, hardcore, survival skill)
                | from New Vegas to the Capital Wasteland. It provides a bridge to connect the stories in
                | a logical fashion.
            p
                | However it does have its short comings. Fallout 3 voice modulation does not work
                | without the user re-encoding the audio. The Rock-it-Launcher does not work as seamlessly
                | as in Fallout 3. Grass distance is reduced due to a New Vegas engine bug (may be overcome with NVAC).
                | Many Fallout 3 mods need a lot of work to be converted (e.g. Mothership Zeta Crew). Additionally
                | patches need to be made for Fallout New Vegas mods to extend functionality to the Capital Wasteland.
                | Balance is completely different as starting in Goodsprings at level 1 is very different than starting
                | at level 30. Those are a few of the snags of playing Tale of Two Wastelands.
            p
                | If the downsides outweigh the benefits for you, Tale of Two Wastelands may not be for you.
                | Otherwise proceed with the guide, the following will set up the rest of the guide, so follow
                | along closely. Happy modding!

        h3.section-header Plugin Limit
        div.copy-bg
            p
                | The game engine for Fallout New Vegas has quite a few issues, but instead of working
                | to solve those problems, a limit on the number of plugins was instituted during one of
                | the patches. There is now a ~140 plugin limit, which will cause issues or just not load at
                | all if this number is reached. In addition to that, the stability of New Vegas will decrease
                | as the number of plugins start to approach 140.
            p
                | The goal will always be to have, at most, 135 plugins. If adding mods on top of the guide,
                | be aware of the plugin cap and learn to use the FNVEdit merge script to lower the count.
                | This is also the reason that Wrye Flash NV is so essential, since the Bashed Patch will lower
                | plugin count.
