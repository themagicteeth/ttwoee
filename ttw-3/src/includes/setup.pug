            | It is important that the games installation files are as close to vanilla as possible.
            | Follow the steps below to ensure that your game is free from previous modding files and
            | that the ini files are reset to their default state.

            +important If this is not a clean installation of Fallout New Vegas and you have modded prior perform the following:
                pre.mt0
                    | Delete everything in the New Vegas folder except the Data folder.
                    | Open the Data folder and delete everything that is not a vanilla ESM or BSA from New Vegas or the DLCs.
                    | If you have previously "cleaned" the base game ESMs, delete those as well, as TTW requires them uncleaned.
                    |
                    | Go to New Vegas in Steam, right click, and select [Properties].
                    | Navigate to [Verify Game Cache] option and Steam will download all the necessary files.
                    |
                    | Optional Tip: Making a archive of the clean game installation with 7Zip is handy for reinstalling Fallout.

        div#reset-inis
            h4.section-header Reset Inis
            +important To ensure the INI files are the vanilla INI files perform the following:
                pre.mt0
                    | Navigate to My Games/Documents and delete the following files:
                    |
                    | Fallout.ini
                    | FalloutPrefs.ini
                    |
                    | This will allow the INIs to revert back to vanilla when the game is launched.

            | The following mods are very important to a any modded Fallout. The first mod, New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) allows 
            | for many game changing things to be added into the game, while the 4GB New Vegas Loader (4GBNV) allows for more memory 
            | to be used by the game, which allows for better graphics and more things to be going on at once.

            +notes
                | The New Vegas Script Extender, or NVSE for short, is a modder's resource that expands the scripting capabilities 
                | of Fallout: NV. It does so without modifying the executable files on disk, so there are no permanent side effects.
                | Without NVSE, many mods that add incredible features to Fallout New Vegas cannot be used.

            | Now that the base game is properly configured, the next step is to set up our mod management utility.
            |
            | Mod Organizer is the mod manager of choice for the following reasons:
            |
            | 1) Profiles allow multiple configurations set up per character and/or playthrough.
            | 2) Mod Downloads via NXM allows downloading of mods directly using the "Download With Manager" button on the Nexus site.
            | 3) Mod Version Tracking uses the power of the Nexus site to track major mod updates. However, this is not a replacement for the track file option on the actual Nexus site for optional downloads!
            | 4) NMM Installer Compatibility allows the use of Nexus Mod Manager installers.
            | 5) Manual Installation Option allows modification and selection of the data folder in an archive manually, allowing fixes of path problems at install time.
            | 6) Virtual File System allows a clean base Fallout installation without the mess of moving files. Additionally extends this file system to other tools such as LOOT, FNVEdit, and Wrye Flash NV.
